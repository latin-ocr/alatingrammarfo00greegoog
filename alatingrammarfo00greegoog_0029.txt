2. Early Forma—The alphahet in the time of Cicero
(N. D. ii. 37) consisted of “one and twenty letters.” These
were -

aiaceef.s‚arstnan‚0.r.q.r.s.au‚z

y and z were added, in words derived from Greek. i and u,
when used as consonante (⁶⁶ semi-vovent), having the sound of
y and vr, are generally writtenj and v: as, juvenis for iuuenis.

a. Iu early use, e was not distinguished in form or sound from
g. After the distinction was made, 0 was still used, convention-
ally, as the initial of names (Gaius, Gnaeus) beginning properly
with G. It came, in later use, to take the place of k, which was
retained only in abbreviations, or as the rnitial letter ofa few
words, as Kalendae, Karthago, in which it is followed by a.

b. Till aster the age of Augustus, u was never, in good use,
preceded in the same syllable by u or v. In many words, as in
volt, servos, o was written where later custom ailows u; while
o was regularly used for qu in such words as oum (for quum),
eous (for equus), relicus (for reliquus), locuntur (for lo·
quuntur), and the like; also in cotidie (for quotidie), and
a few other words. The old forms quom (for cum) and quor
(for cur) are also found.

c. At the end of a few words-as sed, apud, illud,—
twas ancientiy written instead of d In words ending in -e,
finale was often elided (Cic. Orat. 48), as in qualist (qualis-est),
plenu· fidei (Senect. l).

3. Chalcaea—Latera are often changed, according to
general lawa of inflection (vowel-increase), or to secure an
easier or smoother sound (euphonia change); or have been

altered or lost through long use (phonett'c dercy). Of such
changes arc tho following: -

a. Vowels arc strengthened in inflection and derivation (vowel ·

increase): as, ago, egi (cf. tell, told); disco, doceo (cf. falisia ‚·
sit, set), pendo, pondue; persono, perseum perfidus, lidus,
foedus (cf. bird, ὁαηό).

Nora-The primitive vowel-sound may be assumed to be a, as
in futla. Starting with this, and gradually contracting the palate,
we form in successicn the sound ose (rit and i (ee), leading to the
semi-vowelj (y). By contracting the lips, we in like manner form
the sound of o and u (ool, leading to the semi-vowel v (ro). By
contracting both late aad laps, we form the French sound of u,-
in Greek v, an in Latin y. This, which is
called the Vowel-Scale, is of great service in
tracing the modificatione of vowel-sounds. It . .
may be represented thus:-
