1: 3.] nurnomc effluens. 3

b. Vowels are weakened by negligent pronunciation for long
periods of time (phonetic decep). Thus, on one side of the scale,
a becomes e, then i; or, on the other, becomes o, then τις while
u end i meet in the French u (y): as, agmen, agminis; ficio,
eonsseio, confectum aelio, exsult03 sepelio, sepultum ebur,
eberis; maxumus, maximus (ef. master, mester, mistress).

c. Two vowcls coming together are contracted into s single
sound: as, obit (obiit), cogo (eo-ago), nil (nihil), debeo (de-
hibeo). coetus (coitus), ingeni (cf. muyhem, staina).

d. The semi-rowels j and v are lost before a vowel, contrac-
tion sometimes also taking place: as, obicit (ebjieit), conicit
(conjicit), cunctus (conjunctus), rursus (reversus), contio
(conventio), motum (meritum).

e. Between two vowels, or before m or m s becomes r: ss,
genus, genesim maereo, maestum veternus (vetus-nus),

carmen (casinen), dirimo (dis·imo), diribso (dis-habeo).

f· When two consonants come together by derivatim, inflec-
tion, or composition, nn essier pronunciationis secured thus ι -

1. The first is entirely assimilated to the second. Thus, aliquid,
-m, n, or (less frequently) r-hefore another liquid is changed to
that liquid [hut r is not changed to ιιι οι ιι]; ss, collegio (eon-lepo),
oonfpo (eom-repo), itudo (inludo), illice (in ioco), intellego (interimo),
asellus (animellas). So d before l: as inlepidus (aepistulas) ; and h
(rurely) before a liquid: as, surrunitto (submitto).

2. The former is assimilated in kind. Thus :-a. A sonentbeforea
surd becomes surd: as, rapo, ieri (x=cs), tectum· nubo, nupsi, sriptum,¹

coquo, cori, coctum. - b. A surd before a sonant becomes sonantes in ,

seynrenmm (seco).-c. A labiel nasal before s dentnl mute sometimes
becomes dental: contendo (conr-tende), jandndrrm (jum dudum), erravitne
(quamtus).-d. A dental nasal before a labial sometimes becomes labiel:
ss, impono (in-pono). -e. d and t before t sometimes become s (see li:
as, equester (spuet-ter), est (edi).

3. The former is lost, having probably been flrst assimilated.
Thus z-a. d and t ere lost before s, but sometimes only assimilnted:
es, pedes (pedem), ves (sads, vedis), esse (edse, edo).-h. o and g eie
lost before t and s when l or r precedes: as, sortus (=sarctus, sar-
cio), mulsi (=ntulqsi, mulgeo), indultus (=indulpisrs, indulgeo). —c. c and g
are sometimes lost before m and n: as, exemeri (scapnam), lura (luc-
to), lernen (luc-men).

4. The second is partially assimilated to the first (as in English
wreelced becomes, in pronounclng, rechem in this case both sre often
changed. Thus, after n and l-rarely efter other letters—t be·
comes s (the continued sound corresponding to the explosive ti: as,
ereneus (=mantus, marceo), pulsus (pello), casus (cado), passus (=pettm‚
potior), sparsus (τιμωρίας, spargo), tensus (tendo, but also tentus), fiens
(fipo, but fimes from fiwyo), tremimus (for moytimus), lapsus (hibor),

passm (pando).

Nora-After m, before s or t, p is inserted for euphony: ss,
seeo, sumpsi, scriptum. So hiemps fbr hiems.
