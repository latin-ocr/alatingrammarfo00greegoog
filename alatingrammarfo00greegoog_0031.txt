y. Especially the final consonant of prepositions was astabat
to the imtral consonant of verbs.

Thus, ad is assimilated before c, g, p, t: less regularly before
l, r, s, and rarely before m; while before f, n, q, tha form adis
to be preferred;-nbis not assimilated‚ but may take the form ι,

Nora-In most of these cases the later editions prefer the
unaltered forms throughout; but the changes given above have good
authority. Others, which are corruptions of the middle ages (aa
aarum for adeum), would better be avoided.

lt. The combinatione ci and ti before a vowel are found inter·
changed in many words: as inhiantius or nuncius; contio or con·
cio ,· ιιι in these cases only one is correct: as, contio, dicio.

Nora-The substitution of c for t is an example of phonetic
dewy, and belongs to a later period of the language. In ltahan, z,
and in Spanish‚ c, has regularly taken the place of t in such combi-
natione: asin nacione, namon. The sound ofs (ossibr'lation) οι of ιι
traceable in them led gradually to the adoption of this as the regular
sound of c before e ori·

f. The aspirata h is occasionally used to indicate the hard
sound of c, as in pulcher for pulcer. Many words are written
sometimes with and sometimes without an initial h: as, arena
οι harena, ariolor οι bartolot, erus οι herus. The combina-
tions ph. tn, are found only in words taken from the Greek.
