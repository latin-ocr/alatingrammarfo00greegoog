Nora-The distinction of Quantity was carefully observed
by the ancients, but came to he almost wholly disregarded in
later times except in the composition of Latin verse.

Β. Some of the most general rules of quantity are the fol-
lowing : -

a. A vowel before another vowel is short: as in vla, nitati.
b. A diphthongis long: as in aedes, foedus.

e. A syllable formed by contractiori is long: as,m1(mihi);
nil (nihil); intrarat (intraverat); nemo (nb homo)

Nora—In many textbooks and old editions, contractionis de
noted by a circumflex : as, rut, intrarat.

d. A syllable in which a vowel is followed by two consonante,
or a double consonant, is long: asin rectus, duxit. Sometimes
the vowel itself is made long, as before ns in praeseus

e. A syllable in which a short vowel is followedby a mute with
¹l or r is conamen, -that is, it may be long in verse: as, blicrla

Rnnsnn. -Many final syllables, originally long, are always found
pllpppgnrspo 1plaseio Latin: for example, the stem-vowel a of the first

Nora. -The sign (¹) denotes theta vowel is loaq,· (⁹) that it is
alant,¹ (Ἴ that it is common.

4. Aecnnr.

1. The aceent of Latin words never falls on the final
syllable, but is eonfmed to one of the two preceding.

Β. The following are general rules of acuent:-

a· Words of two syllables are always aeeeuted on the first
syllable: as, b‘rant, they were ; di'as. day.

b. Words of more than two syllables are aecented on the
Penult‚ if that is long: as, imi'cus,friand ,· if it is short or cons·
mon, then on the Antepenult: as, db'minns, i‘laeris.

Nonn- The Penult is the last syllable but one ; the Antepennlt,
the last but two.

e. When an Enclitic is joined to a word, the aecent falls on
die syllable next before the enclitio, whether long or short: as,
dth'qna. amirb‘ve, tibi‘ne, ita'que, aad so, as dnmguahed
from l‘thns, thessere. η
