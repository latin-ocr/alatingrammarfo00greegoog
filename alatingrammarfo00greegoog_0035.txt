1. Inflection is a change made in the form of aword, to
show its grammatica] relations.

a. Changes of inflection sometimes take place in the body of a
word, but ostener in its termination: as, vora a boica vocis, of
a colcu vbco. l call; vbcat, le calls ,· vocavit, be bus collad.

b. Terminations of inflection had originally an independent
meaning, aad correspond nearly to the use of prepositions or per·
sonal ronouns in nglish: thus, in abeat. the terminationis
equivaiirnt to le or sle ‚· and in vbcis, to the preposition os.

e. Changes of inflection in the body of averb usually denote
relations of lime or manner, and correspond to theuso of auxiliary
verbs in English: thus, in frangit (root frag), lac breaks or as
beakiny, the form of the word indicates Present time or continued
action3 while in fregit, be brolcc or lus broken, it indicates Past time
or Completed action.

2. The body of a word, to which the terminations are
attached, is called the Srsm.

α’. lhe Stem conmins the idea of the word without relations3
but, in general, it cannot be used without some termination to
ax ress these. Thus the stem vbe- denotas voice; with -s added
it iecomes vox, a voice or lle voice, as the subject or agent of an
action3 with -is it becomes vecla, and signifies os a ooice.

b. A still moro primitive form, expressing the main idea less ·
definitely, and common also to other werde, either in the same or
other languages, is called a Reor. For example, the root ars is
found in the Sanskrit stilliana, Greek ἱστημι, Latin sistere and
aare, German slehen. and English stand.

Again‚ the root os the stem vbc· is vbc, which means not lo
call, or I call, or calling, but merely call ; and cannot be used to
mean any thing without terminations. With a it becomes voca,
the stem os the present vbca'tmus. we call; with fivi- it is the
stem of the perfect vbcivi, I called‚· with ito· it becomes the
stem of the participle vocatus. colled; with ition- it becomes
the stem of vocationis, of a calling. With its vowel lengthened
it becomes the stem of vox, cvoioe (that by which we call) 3 with

ille added it means belonging lo a eois& with iila, a lilllc voice.
