Nora-Thus, ln inflected languages, words are built from
Boon, which at a very early time, long before Latin was a istinct
language, were used alone to express ideas, as is now done in
Chinese. Roots are modifled into Stems, which, by inflection,
become Words. The process by which they are modifled, in the vari·
oua forms of derivatives and compounds, is called stem-building.

ο. The Stcm ia sometimes the same with the Root: aa in
dite-is, fer·t; bnt is more frequently formed from the root,
either (1) by changing or lengthening its vowel, aa in reg-ln,
‘ditem (2) hythe addition or insertion of a consonant, as in
tendo, pango; (3) by the addition ofa terminal vowel, as in
fugis, fuga, or (4) by derivation and composition, following the
laws of development peculias to the language.

d. The terminations of inflection are variously modified by
combining with the final vowel or consonant of the Stem, leading
to the various forms of Decleusion and Conjugation.

Nora-A termination beginning with a vowel is called an opes
affirm one beginning with n consonant, a close offla. When a close
afflx is joined to a consonantstem, there is usually either a euphonia
change, as rexi for roy-ai, or avowel appears, as req-ibus. But in most
cases, what is called a connecting vowel really belongs to the stem,
aa ln voca-mna, regi-mna.

8. Nouus, Adjectives, Pronouns, and Participles have in·
flectione of dcclcnsion, to denote gender, number, and case;

aud Verbs of conjugatione, to denote voice, mood, tense, num·
ber, aud person.

4. Those parts of speech which are not inflected are called
Panaretus: these are Prepositions, Conjunctions,and1nter·
jections, with Adverbs of time, phare, and manno.

Nora. - The term Particles is sometimes limited to such words aa
num, -ne, an (interrogative), non, ne (negotioe), sl (corrdhional), fac,
which are used simply to indicate the form or construction of a sen·

tenca. Interiections are not roperly to be classed among parts of
speech, and differ little from inarticulate sounds. For convenience,
alist is given of those in most common use, following the conJunc·

tions (p. 95).

6. Gaisonis.

1. The gender of Latin nouns is either natural or pram·
moal.

a. Natural gender is distinction as to the aex of the object
denoted: aa, puer, toy, puelpp. girh donum, gifl.
