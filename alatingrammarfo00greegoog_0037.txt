h. Many masculine nouns have a corresponding feminine form:
as, servus, serva, slew cliens, clienta. client3 victor, vio·
trix, coitqueror. Most designatione os persons (as, nauta, scallor,
miles, soldier), usually though not necessarily male, are masculine.

o. Grammatical gender is a like distinction where no sex
exista in the object, and is shown by the form of the adjective
joined with it: as, lapis magnus (u), a preat stone3 manus
msa (u), my hond.

d. A lew neuternouns are used to designate persons as belong-
ing to a class: as, mancipium tuum, your slave. N ames of classes
or bodies ol persons may be of either gender: as, exercitus(u.),
acies (ra), and agmen (a), auuy5 and the feminine operas,
marhuan, copiae, troops.

Nora-What we call grammatleol pendor is in most cases the ¹

produnt of the imagination at arude age, when language was in the
course ol growth. Thusa River was seen, or a Wind was felt, as a
lioinq creature, violent and strong, and so is masculine; a Month is a
guida or diuidet of tasks, and so is masculine; and the fable ol Atlas
shows how similar living attributes were ascribed to Mo··ntains‚
which, in the northern lables, are the bones of giants. Again,tl1e
Earth, or a country or city, seems the mother of its progeny3 the Tree
shelters and ripens its fruit, as a brooding birdhernest of eggs; and,
to this day, a Ship is always referred to by a feminine pronoun.
Again‚ in the llast and South, the Sun, from its lierce heat and
splendor, is masculine, and its paler attendant, the Moon, feminine;
while, among northern nations, the Snn (perhaps for its comforting
warmth) is feminine, and the Moon (the appointer ol works and

· days) masculine. The rules of grammatical gender only repeat and

extend these early workiugs of the lancy.

2. Names of Male beings‚ together with Rivers, Winds‚
and Mountains are musculiue; names of Female beings‚
Cities, Countries‚ Planta, of many Animals (especially Birds)‚

and of most abstraet Qualities are semim—ne.

Nora-Most of the above may be recognized by their termina·
tions, according to the rules of gender under the several declensions.

’ a. Names of Rivers are masculine, except a saw, chiefly in a.

These are Albula, Allia, Druentia, Durio, Goruruaa, sinuosa, Mo· ·

sellim also Lethe and Styx. Many are variable.

Nora. -Names ol Months are properly Adjectives‚ the masculina
noun hiemis being understood.

h. Names of Towns, Islands, and Trees in us are feminine3
also, many names ol' Plants and Gems in us.

o. Indeclinable nouns, Terms or Phrases used as nonna, and
words quoted merely for their forms, are neuter: as, nihil, nortiam
gummi, pum; scira tuum, your leonium triste vale, o sodsore·
well; hoo ipsum diu, this same word diu3 hoo totum diserte
dicere (De Or. ii. 10), this whole matter of eloquent speaking.
