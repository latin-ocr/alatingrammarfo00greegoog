8. Uace-Forma. The genitive singular anciently ended in
ds (cf. is of first declensiou); and si was sometimes contracted
into l or e, as in tho phrase plebi-scitum, people's deorse (F r.
plebiscito). An old dative in i or e also occurs.

4. Several noune of the fisth declension have also forms of ths
first, of which this is only a variety: as, materia, -ies, titubo,-
saevitia, ies, madiy.

Nora-Nouos in ies (except dies) are original a-stems. The
others are probably (excepting res) corrupted sstems, like moise,
molestum· dies, diurnus ,· spes, spero. Reqoiss (etis) has also forms of
this deciension: with others, as sotios (for catinos), irc.

ὅ. The Locative form of this deelension is represented by -c,
asin hodic, todem perendie, day-ofter-io-morrow5 dic quarti,
ihsfocrih day ; pridie, tie ‹ioy before.

o. of about forty nouns os this declension, the only ones com·
plcte in all their parts are dies and res. Most want the lural‚
which is, however, found in the nominative, accusative, on voca·
tivo, in the following: acies, effigies, eluvies, facies, glacies,
progenies, series, species, spes.
