Noun-These words, in Greek and Sanskrit, are treated as pro-
nouns; which accords with the pronominal forms of the genitive in
ius, the detivein 1, and the neuterd in uliud. The lin the geni·
tire dus, though long, may be made short in verse; and alterius is
generally accented on the ente enuit Instead of altos (gen), olle

nos is more commonly used.

a. Several stems in ri· form the masc. nom. in er (as acer,
compare § 11, 1. 2, h). These are the following:-

soer, leem.

celeber, famous.
equester, of aeream.
paluster, morshy.

pedester, on soor.
puter, refiert.

saluber, wholesome.
silvester, wooded.

terrester, of tlte land.
volucer, wrnpcd.

Also celer, celeris, celere, swijl5 snd, in certain phrases, the

names of months in ·ber.

Nora-This formation is not original; and hence, in the poete,
and in early Latin, either the masculine or feminine form of these
adjectives was used for both genders. In others, as mastos, lupulus,
mediocris, mulctris, there is no separate masculine form.

b. case-Forma. These adjectives, as true l-stems, retain
1 in the abl. singular, the nent. plural la, thegen. plur. lum, and
osten in the acc. plur. is, hut never im in the acc. sing. For metri·
cal reasons, an ahl. ine sometimes occurs in poetry. When celer
is used as an adjective,‘it has the regular gen. plur. in ium; as a
noun, denoting a military rank, it is celerum: as a proper name,

ithsstheablme
