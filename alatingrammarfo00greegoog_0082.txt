b. The Perfect indicative also sometimes adds them directly3
ἓξὲξ) ἐυὲξὴᾱῗὲ form of the root called the persecutam: aa, dadi.

Noun. -The l of the Perfect, which in early Latin is always burg
(ci, l, e) except before mus, is of doubtful origin. It is treated for
convenience aa part of the stem, aa itis in dodi, steti, where it takes
the place of the vowel a Iu the sufflxes vl (=ful) and sl (= Skr.
cro), und in the parfects of consonantroots, it seems to be, but prob
ably is not, u mere connecting vowel. The s before ti and tls is
elso auomulous. Most scholars regurd it as a temnant of es; but it
may be, like the others, of pronominul origin.

c. All other true verbnl forms are compounded with a suffix-
originully a verb-which contains the ersoual endings: as,
vocar-eram, vocar-ero, voca-bo. e first raon of tha
Perfeci, thus compounded, produces another formo perfeci deu:
annecti-vl.

d. The Present Infinitive Active, Preaent Participle, aud
Gerundive, add uominal (noun or adjective) suffixes to the pruove
rtem: as, venire, vocans (ande), vocandua

c· The Perfeci infinitivo adds an infinitive (essa) already
formed to the peffect atem: aa, vocavisse (= vocavi-asse).

Ι. 'I'he Per-fect and Futuro Participles aud the Supiueare
formed upon what is called amplectione, which adds t:- either to
the Preseut stem orto the Root: aa, veuit, tect· (root bbg).

Nona-strictly, these have no common stem, but are formed
with special suffixes (to, turo, tu). As, however, the form to
which they are added is the same for each, and as the suffixes all
begin with t, it is convenient to give the name supine rtem to tha form
int The participle in to correspouds tothe Greek verbal -ros3 that
in turo is a development of the noun of ugency ending iu ·tor (as
vlctor, victurus) ; that in tu· is an abstract noun of the fourth
chensiou (5 12, 4, a).

o. The Present Infinitive Passive is an anomalous form, msde
by addin -rl or l to the erent stem: as, voco, vobim tego,
regu (tinen l is added,t final vowelof the stem disappears.)
It was auciently followed by er.

Ιι. The Future Infinitive Passive is supplied by the au ine in
tum with the infinitive passive osso, to go, used impersouaffy: as,
vocatum lrl. to he about to bc cabod.

'Nora-The construction of this infinitive is different from the
others, the form in tum being invariable, aud the apparent subject
accusative being really the object of the supine taken actively. Few
verbs?e influetl bave this form, for which fore ut with the subjunctive
