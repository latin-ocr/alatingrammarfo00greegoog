b. The stem-vowel ὅ ia weekened to l in several forms of the
Preseut indicative and imperative3 is lengthened to ὅ in the imper
fect; and undergoes other changes exhibrted m the paradigm.

ο. sse Future is formed (without the suffix bo) by vowel-
ehanges to a and ο before the personui endings.
Nora-The a (properly long) of the future is horrowed from

the present subjunctive; the forms iu o have the same origin as the
present subjunctive of the lint conjugation, and ere properly optative.

d. The Perfect stem ia formed in five different ways: -

1. The root is reduplicated: as in redo, occidi: carro,
etloum: diseo, didici.

2. 'Ibe rootrowel is ίηονεοοοᾶ, ἰοοοοωίος ὃ, and i. ὅ, t being
simply lengthened: as in cepio, 05913 iddio, fodi ; illato, ffigt.

³. The same form appears iu the perfect as in the present stem:
this is regular with verbs of this conjugation in uo (vo): as, acuo,
acui: eolvo, solvi

Nora-It is probable that in the last two ceses the root was

originally reduplicatsd; but that the reduplication was retained only
where vowel-increase did not take place.

4. The suffia sl is added to the root: as in carpocarpei:
gero, gessi: admo, sumpsi: dieo. dixi: tego, text.

5. The suffix ul (vi) is added to the root: as iu odio, colun
fremo, fremui: gigno, genum rapio, rapui Before this suffix
along vowel of various origin is often found: as in cispio, cupi·
vi: peto, petivi: sperno. sprivt

Nora-Both srrffixes ure combined in the following: necto,

nexnl; pleeto, plexul. A fev verbs vary: aa, pango, panxl (pegi
or pepigl)¹; vello, velli or vniat

ο. The Present subjunctive changes etoi: as‚vehbre.vehis.

Nom. -This form with ὀ corresponda to the Greek and Sanskrit
subjunctive with long vowel, and proceeds from the addition of
Ι another a (thoth compare lxpe, culmi.

Ι. The Supine stem is formed by adding to the root t. which
in many cases takes euphonically the form s· (ξ 1, 3, f. 4).

Nom-A few roots take a connecting vowel before this affix,
and some have both forms. When this is the cese, the lhture partio
ciple and derivative verb take the longer form: es, ortus, oriturns3

aetus (ago), agito.

o. Some verbs of the third coujugation form the other parts
upon the (modified) present stem as a root: as, fingo, finxi, fiot-

(flsh jungo, iunxt janoe (ilis)-

Ιι. In verbs which addito the root in the present stem, this
vowel is lost where it would be followed by ὅ or 1 (except iu the

future third person singulnr): es incepit caperet, capiet.
