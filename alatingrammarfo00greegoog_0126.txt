2. Dertvattort of Verba. Verbs of the third conju-
gation, with irregular verbs and vowel-stema dt, na are
primitiae. Most others are either cannino or denominativa
(formed from nouus).

Nonn-The oenadousneas of mna was lost ln Latin, so thatin
forming the parts of verbs only stema are dealt nith. Thus moneo,
nonni (not menni), from root nen, as inmens‚· coedo, cecidi (notarent),
from root (cdd, asin oddo). For modificatione of the root in verbetems,

manner from noun-stems3 but most add the characteristic ὃ to the
root, and are intransitive or neuter in their meaning.

conjugation, becoming either active or intransitive, as acuo fluo.
