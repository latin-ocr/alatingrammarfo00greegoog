Nora-A Relative is properly an adjective n, of which the
proper noun (the Antecedent) ie usually omitte . The full construo
tion would require a corresponding demonstrativo, to which the relative
refers. Hence, relatives serve two uses :- 1. As Nouus iu their own
clause ; 2. Aa Counectives, and are thus often equivalent to a demon
ntrotioe and conjunction combined (see ᾗ 69). The connectite force is
not ongiual, bnt is developed l'rom a demonstrative or indefinita
ΜἪ getiae relative and the antecedent clause being originally
ooo a .

1. A Verb having a relative as its subject mkes the person
of the expressed or implied antecedent: aa,

adsum qui feci (AEn. ix. 427), here em I who didit.

h. A relative generally agrees in gender with a noun
(appositive) in its own clause, rather than withan antecedent
of different gender: as,

mare etiam quem Neptunum esee dicebas (N. D. iii. 20), the
sea, too, which you sard wer Neptune.

a. A relative may (rarely) by Attraction agree with its ante·
cedent in eoae: as,

si aliquid agas eorum quorum censuisti (Fam. v. 14), r'f you do
something os what you are used to.

b· A relative may agree in gender and number with an impluat
antecedent: as,

quartum genus . . . qui premuntur (Cat. ii. ιο), a fourth class,
that are stnhr'ng.

uuus ex eo numero qui parati erant (Jug. 35), one osthe number
[of those] who were ready.

3. The antecedent noun sometimes appears in both clauses3
usually only in the one that precedes3 sometimes it is wholly
omitted: thus-

a. The noun may be repeated in the relative clause: aa,

loci natura erat haecquem locum nostri delegerant (B. G.ii. 18),
the nature os the ground which our men had chosen was thir.

b. The noun may appear only in the relative clause: as, ·

quas ree in consulatu nostro gessimus attigit hic versibus
(Arch. 11), he has touched in verse the thrhgs which we did
