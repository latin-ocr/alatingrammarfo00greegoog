63. Vocrrrvn

The Vocativc is thc form of direct Address: as,

Tiberine pater, ta sancte precor (Liv. ii. 103), Ofatter Tiberi
thee, hely one, I prcy.

Norn. -Thc Vocative can hardly be called a case, as it properly
hes no case termination, and forms no part of the sentence.

α· Sometimes the nominative of a noun is used instead of the
vocative, in apposition with the subjectos the Imperative: as,

audi tu, populus Albanus (id. i. 24), hear, thou people ofAlta.

b· Sometimes the vocative of an adjective is used instead of the
nominative, where the verb is of the second person: as,

censorem trabeate salutas (Pers), robed you salute the censor.

So in the phrase,

macte [= magne, root arne] virtute esto (Hom), be enlargtd
in manlt‘ttess [hravo, well done].

54. Annnnvn.

The Ablativc is used to denote the relations cx· =
pressed in English by the propositione from, in,
at, nith, ty.

Nora-The Ablative forn contains three distinct casea-the
ablativa proper, expressing the relation raom the locative, ηις end
the instrumental, wrrn or av. This confusion has arisen partly
from phonetic decay, by which the cases have become identical in
form, and partly from the development by which they have ap
proached one another in meaning. Compare, for the first, the like
forms of the dative and ablative plural, the old dative in e of the fll'th
declension, and the loss of the original d ln the ablative; and, sor the
second, the phrases a parte dextra, os tlte netu quam oh causam,
rnen which canse3 ed samam, ar (in consequence of) tte repert.

The relation of raon includes separation, source, cante, ayant, and
compensem that of nv or ar, plone, time, circumstance ; that of wrrn or
nv, accompaniment, instrument, means, manner, quality, and price. It is
probable that, originally, the idea ofacconpantncnt had a separate case,
which became confounded with the instrumentet before the Latin was
separated from the kindred tongues.
