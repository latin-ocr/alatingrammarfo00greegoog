Nom-The Present subjunctive contains two distinct forms, -
the Subjuuctive sud Optative ol ths ‘⁴ Indo-European'' tongue. Both
these forms had originally afuturo mesuiug; und from these hrture
mecnings sll tho uses of this mood in Latin sre developed. The
sejunctim proper wss orimnully s Prcsent, deuoting οοηιὶιιιιιιίλ αιτιοι,
which becsme Future in seule (compare conative present end present
ior future. ἓ 58, 2, h) ; end asteriscum, iu msuy uses, Imperstivc (com-
pure future for imperative). The optative contains, in composition, e
pust tense oi the mot 1 (whence eo, εἶμι, 9ο); so thst it hed u ficorum
in ρνωιιτίιο meaning, which developed into s conditional future, end into
ιιι expression of wish snd missod ; sud, in Latin, lost its connection
with pest time.

'rue other tenses ol the subjunctive ere ccmpounds formed (in
Latin alone) to remedy the confusion oi optative sud subjunctive.

The Subjnnctive hus, therefore, the uses cf both the optative und
subjunctive of the cognsts lungnnges.
