Some of these verbs -jubec and veto regularly-may take the
infinitivo with another subject: es,

signa inferri jubet (Liv. xlii. 59), bc orders the standards to
bc borne forward.

Nera-This construction, though in many cases different hom
the tvo preceding, chades off imperceptihly into them. Iu none of
the uses is the infinitive strictly Subject or Object ; but its meaning
is developed from the original one ol' purpose. Hence the distinction
between the uses is not always clearly marked.

o. With Subiect Accusative. The infinitive, with subject
accusative, is regularly used alter words of lcaowiny, thinking,
telliay, and the like (verba sentiendi et declarandi, ξ 67, 1):
as

dicit montem ab hostibus teneri (B. G. i. 22), be says that tte

till is held by tle enemy.

19), what isso according to nature assor old rnen to diet

cate (except after impersonale) takes the case of the subject: as,

if there were saith in tlrose in whom it ouglet to bc greatest.
