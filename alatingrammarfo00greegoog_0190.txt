ex epistulis intellegi licet quam frequens fuerlt Platonis auditor
(Or. 4), it may be understood from kis letters kow constant a
kearer ke was of Plato.

c. In denses of Result, the perfect subjunctive is very oden
(the present rarely) used after seoondary tenses: as,

Hortensius ardebat dicendi cupiditate sic ut iri nullo unquam
flagrantius studium viderim (Brut. 88), Hortensiae was so kat
witk desire os speaking tkat I never saw a more turning
ardor ia any nran.

Siciliam Verres per triennium ita vexavit ac perdidit, ut ea
restitui in anti uum statum nullo modo poelt (Verr. i. 4),
sor three years [ erres] so racked and ruined Sicily, tkat ske
can in nc way be restored to kerfcrnier state.

Reicies-This construction gives more emphasis to the fact
stated as a result3 while the regular one gives more prominenoe
to the main clause. The perfect, thus used, can stand only for a
perfect indicative, not aii imperfect, and, in general, the perfect is

often represented hythe perfect subjunctive, contrary lo the
general rule: as,

Thorius erat ita non superstitiosus ut illa plurima in suh pa·
tria et sacrificia et fana contemnerct; ita non timidus ad
mortem ut in acie sit ob reni publicam interfectus (Fin. ii.
20), Tkorr‘us was sc little su erstiticus tkat le despised [con-
temnebat] tke many sacri ces and skrines in kr's country, so
little timorons about deatk tkat ke was killed [interfectus est]
in battle, in desence of tlte state.

Zeno nullo modo is erat qui nervos virtutis inciderit [compare
5, d]; sed contra qui omnia in uiri virtute poneret (Acad. i.
ιο), Zeno was noway one to cat tke sinews os virtue ,¹ but one,
on tke contrary,ka made everytking depend on virtue alone.

d. Α general truth after a past tense follows the connection
of tenses in Latin (though not usually iii English) : as,

ex his quae tribuisset sibi quam mutabilis esset reputabat (Qc.

iii. 9), from what ske [Fortune] kad bestowed on kain, ke re·
flected kow inconstant ske is.

ibi quantam vim ad stimulandos animos ira haberet, apparuit ⁵

(Liv. xxxiii. 37), kere lt appeared wkat power anger kas to
, gaad tke mand.
e. 'l'he historical present, oi· the present with dum, may he
followed hy either primary oi· secondary tenses, biit more ooni-
monly hy recondary: as,

rogat ut curet q'uod dixisset (Quinct. 5), ke asks kim tc attend to

tke tking ke lad spoken os· · 1 θ
castella communit quo facilius prohiberi possent (B..G. i. 8),
