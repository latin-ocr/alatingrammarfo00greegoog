A conditional Sentenoe (or clause) is onc beginning
with lr, or some equivalent.

1. Protuots ond Apodosis. In a conditional sentence,
the clause containing the condition is called the Protasis; aud
that containing the conclusion is called the Apodosis: as,

si qui exire volunt [raorssrs], conivere possum [arenosus]
(Cat. ii. 12), if any wt‘sh to depart, Ι can hocp my eyes shut.

a. The Protasls is regularly introduced by the conditional
partiales sl, is,· sin, had is,· nisi (ni), unlus. But a clause in·
troduced by an Indefinite Relative (as quisquis, whoeocr),a
Relative or Concessive Conjnnction (cum, since, quamvis, ul·
thouyh), aParticiple, or an Imperat-ive, is treated as a conditional
clause: as,

quaecunqne causa vos huc attulisset, laetarer (De Or. ii. 4),

I should hc glad, whatever causo had brought you here [he. it
any other, as well as the one which did].

philosophia, cui {ui pareat, omne tempus aetatis sine molestis

possit degere ( ut. Μ. 1), philosophy, which rr any one ohcys,

he will be able to spond his whole lise without venaticos.
virtutem qui adeptus erit ubicunque erit gentium a nobis dili·

getur (N. D. i. 44), if any one shall hauc attached virtue, dc.

[For Implied Conditions, see ς 60.]

Nora-The Indefinite Relative, achone, whatever, whencucr, maybe
regarded as a conditional expression. equivalent to if any one, istu any
tinae, doc, as is seen in the analogyof the Greek ὃς ἂν, transacta the
structure of relative as compared with conditional clauses. In the
Stalutes ol hlassschnsetts, for instance, the phrase “Whoever shall ''
hus been substituted for the old form “ In any person shall,'' &c

b. The Apodosls, being the main clause, dependo in sermon
the grammatical structure of the sentence, which may requires
Partieiple, Infinitive, or Phrasc: as,

quod si praeterea nemo sequatur, tamen se cum sou decimi
legione iturum (B. G. ί. 40), but if no ono eisc would solim,
hc would go with the tenth legion alono.

siquos adversum proelliurp ssssfflessh’, hone 'rema posse (id),

segalltlrhosciu‘hsthebaphhdhlblturi, ni ryix hhmahi jussisset (Q C.
viii. 2), intending also to deprivc him os hurial, unless tho
king had ordered lrirn to hc interred.
