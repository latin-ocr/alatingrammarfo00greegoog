8. Prosent and Post conatusne. A present or pest
condition may be simply stated, implying nothing as to its
sulfilmcnt3 or it may be stated so as to imply that itis na or
was not fullilled.

a. In the statement of a condition wdosefalsity e‘s non· implied,
the present and past tenses oi the Indicative are used iu Protasis3
the spodosis expressing simply what ia, was, orselli be, the result
of the fulfilment (G. 221) : ss,

si tu exercitusque valetis, bene est (Fam. v. e), ifyou audita
army are well, it is well.

si ypptbitia naept, in yitiptest (off. i. 19), ry‘justice be wanting,
r raver isin air .

si placet . . lvideamus (Cat. M. 5), if you please, let ns see.

suerit hoc censoris, si judicabat (Div. i. 16), grant etat etwas
tle censor’s duty eshejudged‚ dc.

quicquid jurdrunt ventus et unda repit (Prop. ii. 28), whatever
they tave sworn [ie. it they have sworn anything], tle nitas
and waves sweep away.

b. In the statement of a supposition bwnn to besalse, the Im-
perfect and Pluperlect subjunctive are used-the imperfect
referring to present time, the pluperfect to past (G. 222): as,

quae si exsequi nequirem, tamen me lectulus oblectaret meus
(Cat. M. 11), is I could not [now] follow this [an active lite]‚
yet my conch would trfford me pleasure.

nisi tu emisisses, nunquam recepissem (id. 4), unless you lad
lost it, I should not haue recovered a.

si meum consilium auctoritasque valuisset, tu hodie egeres,
nos liberi essemus, respublica non tot duces et exercitus
amisisset (Phil. ii. 15), e'f my judgmerd and arcthority tad
yreoailed [es they did not], you would tiis day be a beggar,
we should be free, and tle republt'c would not have lostso
many leaders and armies.

Nora. -The implication of felsity, in this construction, is not in·
herent in the Subjunctive; but comes from tle transfer of a yiaure
condition to past time. Thus the time for the happening cf the condi·
tion has, at the time of wrihng, already pessed3 sc thetis the con·
dition remeius a condition, it must be contrary to fact. So forms
implying a future frequently take the place ol the subjunctive in
epodosis in this construction (see e, below).

c. In many cases the imperfect refers to past time, both in pro-
tasis end epodosis‚ especially when arepeated or continued action
is denoted, or when the conditionis true would still erist: as,

hic si mentis esset suae, ausus esset educere exercitum (Pis. 21),

ef lle {aare of sarto mind would lie dave dared to lead out the
army
