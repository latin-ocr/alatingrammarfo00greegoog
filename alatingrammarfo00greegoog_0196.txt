non concidissent, nisi illud receptaculum classibus nostris
pateret (Verr. ii. 1), [the power of Carthage] would not
haecfallen, unless ilat station lad been open to onrsteets.

d. The past tenses of the indicative in Apodesis (attera sub-
junctive in Protasis) may be used to express what ouplrl to have
been done, or is intended, or is aheady bepnn (see §60, 2, e) : as,

si Romae privatus esset boc tempore, tamen is erat deligendus
(Manil. 17), if he [Pompey] were at this time a private citizen
in Rome, yet lle ought to be appointed.

quod esse ceput debebat, ⁸si probari posset (Fin. iv. 9), what

sioiihfttutrh hehstgte thiliegohhhihliigrfgeierpv'imhh}, tle mollero
were coming rs it lad been allowed.

in amplexus filrae ruebat, nisi lictores obstitissent (Ann. xvi.

32), he was about ruslrng a'nto lis daughter's arms, unless tle
lictors lad opposed.

annn. -In this uss, the imperfect indicative corre onds in
time te the imperfect subjunctive, and the perfect or puperfect
indicative to the pluperfect subjunctive (the tenses of the subjunc-
tive may, however, he used as vvell3 see N ote, above) ε as,

satius erat (esset), it were better.

ι e. This uss is regular with all verbs and expressions denoting
the messity, propricty, duiroblcrress, duty, possibility, of an action
-ineluding the two periphrastic conjugatione (see page 83)-
vhere it is implied that what vas necessary, dre, ltus not been donc.
It is sometimes carried still further in poetry: as,

narn nos decebat lugere (Tusc. i. 47), it would befit us to monrn.
si non alium jactaret odorem, laurus erat (Georg. ii. 133), it
were a lauret, batsor giving out a different odor.

Nom-observo that all these expressions eontein the idea of
Futurity. Compare note underh.

f· So the participle in urus with tul is equivalent to aplu-
persoct subjunctive. Hence, when the Apodosis is itselfa dependent
clause, requiring the subjunctive, a pleperfoct subjunctive may be
represented hy the Futuro Participle with the mh'unuioc of esse
(compare apodesis in Indirsct Discourse, § 6⁷, 1, c): as,

quid enim futurum fuit [=fuisset], si... (Liv. ii. 1), what
would lave happened, is, ὥσ.

neque ambigitur quin . . . id facturus fuerit, si. . . (iu), and
no doubt bc would lave done it, if, etc. [dir. diso,secisset.]

ex quo intellegi potest quam scuti nature sint, qui haec
sine doctrine credituri fuerint (Tusc. i. 21), lencc it may be
understood how keen thoy are by notiore, who, without rirstruc-
tion, worcld have believed this. [Here the condition is con·
tained in the words sr'ne doctrino]
