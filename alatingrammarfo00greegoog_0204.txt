62: 1, a] nausmons or urna. 177

Temporal Particles are the following : -ubl, ut (ut primum,
ut semel), simul atque (simul ac or simul alone), cnm

(quom), antequam, priusquam, postquam (mstaaquam),
dum, donec, quoad, quamdiu, quando

l. The particles ubi, ur, cum, quando, either alone
or compounded with cunque, are used as indeindc relo-

tr'ves, and have the constructions of Protesis (ὃ 59); as,

cum rosam viderat, turn incipere ver arbitrabatur (Verr. v. 10),
wlenever le lad seen a rose, ke thought Spring war begua
[general condition].

cum id malurn esse negas (Tusc. ii. 12), when you [the indi·
vidual disputant] den r't to le an evr'l.

cum videas eos . . . doihre non frangi (id. 27), when you see
[indefinite subject] that those are not broken hypatis, oc.

quod profecto curn me nulla vis cogeret, facere non auderem
(Phil. v. 18), wllr'clr I would sarrely· not venture to do, ns long

rdtbltlnetflllllh lllphlll {hilssllhlill 32),
when be bad said tin, ke [used to] caritha spearr'ntother'r
terrr'torr'es [repeated action].

Ranilum—So eat cum, fult cum, de, are used in general
expressions like est qul. sunt qul (§ 65).

a. Temporal clauses of obsolute lime take the Indicatire3
those of relative lime, the Subjunctive.

(For the definitiou of absolute and relative time, see ἓ 58, 1, 9.)

Noun-This distinction is not made in other languagea but it
may be made clear in the two following expressions ε· 1. When was
the great flre in London'l Ans. When charles 11. was king (abolute
nme). 2. When Charles II. was king (relative time), a great lire broke
out in London. ln the first case the reign of charles is referred to as
an mneflned date, known to the hearer; while iu the second the
time is not so flxed, but is given as relative lo lle event aunated by tle
moin aab, which alone denotes absolute time. In this construction, the
Subjunctive describes the time by its daradoistica (as in§ 65, 2), and
thus is a branch of the Subjunctire of result. Hence this qualitative
character of the tempora! clause osten reappears and occasions tha
Subjunctive, where the idea of relative time would not naturally be
expected: as, tum, cam ulnuunr lroec respublica Luscinos, &e . . . et tam,
cum nnana Gotones, dc. Here the former clause describes tle clor-
lffllllznhltlllht ‘lille illeille attali {l
ne saos’, ee. neg. Agr, u. rii.

a· The particles postquam (posteaquam), ubl, ut (ut
primum, ut semel), simul atque (simul ac or simul alone),
introduce clauses of absolute time, and take the Indicative (usually
the narrative tenses, the perfect and the luteram pranso: as,
