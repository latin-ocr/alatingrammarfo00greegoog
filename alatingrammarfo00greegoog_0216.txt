ut semel), simul atque (simul ac or simul alone), oum

(quom), antequam, priusquam, postquam (posteaquam),
dum, donec, quoad, quamdiu, quando

1. The partiales ubi, ut, cum, quando, either alono
or compounded with cunque, are used as indefinite relu·

tioes, and have the constructions of Protasis (ξ 59): as,

curn rosam viderat, turn incipere ver arbitrabatur (Verr. v. 10),
whenever he lead seen a rose, te thought Sprr'ng was began
[general conditionJ.

curn id malum esse negas (Tusc. ii. 12), when you [the indi·
vidual disputant] den it to be au evil.

curn videas eos . . . dollrre non frangi (id. 27), when you see
[indefinite subject] that those are not broken by paris, cto.

quod profecto cum me nulla vis cogeret, facere non auderem
(Phil. v. 18), wler‘clr I would surely not venture to do. cs long

Nora-This distinction is not made in other languages, but it
may be made clear in the two following expressions τ’ l. When was
the great fire in London? Ans. When Charles II. was king (absolute
dms). 2. When Charles II. was king (relative time), a great lire bruks
out iu London. Iu the first case the reign of Charles is referred to as
au absolue fised date, known to the hearer3 wlula in the second the
time is not so tired, but is given as rehtioe to tlte event mooted ly tle
moia verb, which alone deuote· absolute time. In this construction, tha
Subjunctive describes the time by its characteristico las in§ 65, 2), and
thus is a branch of the Subjunctire of result. Hence this qualitative
character of the tomporal clause ohen reappeurs and occasions the
Subjunctive, where the idea of relative time would not naturally be
expected: as, tum, cum unnuuur laec respublica Luscinos, dc. . . . et turn,
cum untur Catones, &c Here the former clause describes tlte clar-
