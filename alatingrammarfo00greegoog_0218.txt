annm-1· But the imperfect and pluperfeot may denote
ubwlrdc lime, and then are in the indicative: as,

res cum haec scribebam eratin extremum adducta discrimen
(Fam. xii. 6), at the time I write [epistolary] the affair was
brought into great hasard.

quem quidem cum ex urbe pellebam‚ hoc providebam animo
(Cat. iii. 7), when I was about forcing him [conative im·
perfect] from the city, I looked forward to thri.

fulgentes gladios hostiurn videbant Decii cum in aciem eorum
irruebant (Tusc. ii, 24), the Decii saw the flashr'rrg swords of
the enemy when they rushcd upon their line. ,

tum cum in Asia res magnas permulti amiserant (Manil. 7),
at that time, wien many tad lost great fhrtuncs in Assia.

2. When the clauses are inverted, so that the real temporal
clause becomes the main clause, and nicoterae, the Indieative

must be used: as,

dies nondum decem intercesserant, cum ille alter filius infans
necatur (Clu. 9), ten days had not yet passed, when the otker
hgpfsrppteppnnpptsukppppmbant, cum matres familiae repente in
publicum procurrerunt (B. G. vii. 26), they wera preparing
§proculpntllr's ty nr'gllt, when the women suddenly ran out alito tic

3. With Futura tenses, there is no distinction of absolute or
tehtive time; and hence the Indicative is used: as,

non dubitabo dare operam ut te videam, cum id satis commode
facere· potero (Fam. xiii. ι), I shall not karitate to catepano
to croyon, when I can do it concentorem.

longum illud tempus cum non ero (Att. xii. 18), that Iongtime
when Ι shall bc no more.

In the other tenses, the distinction is of late origin: hence in
Plautus quom always takes the Indicatire except where the Sub-
junctive is used for other reasons.

c. In narration antequam and priusquam-also, in late wn't-
ers, dum and donec—have the same construction as cnm: as,

antequam tuas legi litteras (Att. ii. 7), before! read your letter.

nec ante finis fuit quam concessere (Liv. viii. 13), there was no
end until theyyielded [regular with non ante quarn, &c.]·

antequam homines nefarii de meo adventu audire potuissent,
in Macedoniam perrexi (Plane. 41), deferre those evr'l men
could learn os my coming, I arrr'ved in Macedonio.

nec obstitit falsis donec tempore ac spatio vanescerent (Tac.
Ann. ii. 82), nor did he contradict tbcfalseboods till they died
out through lapse of tr'nce.

Rnnanx. -In reference to future time, these articles take the
present and future perfect indicativ03 rarely τῖε future indica·
tivc and present subjunctive: as,
