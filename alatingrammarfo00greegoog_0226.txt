Nora-The subjunctiveinthis use is eitheraProtasis orApodosis‚
aud partakes of the nature of the clause on which it depends,-or
at least of its original nature. Iu all cases except purpose and result,
this is clearly seen. In these, the case is undoubtedly the same; as
the Purpose has, oi course, afutura sense, and the Result is a hrauch
of opodosis. (See “ Essay on the Latin Subjunctive,” page 27.)

Itis often difficult to distinguish between this construction and the
preceding. Thus, in imperat ut ea fiuntque opus essent, essent may
stand for sunt, and then will be Indirect Discourse (under 1, b); or
it may stand for erunt, and will then be Protasis (under a).

67. quramr Drscouasa.

A Direct Quotation is one which gives the exact
words of the original speaker or writer. An Indirect
Quotation is one which adopts the original words to
the construction of the sentence in which they are
quoted.

Ruusun. —The term qumaor Drscounsa (oratio obliqua)
is used to designate all clauses-even single clauses in a sentence
of different construction—which indirectly express the word or
thought of any person other than the speaker or writer, or even
his own under other circumstances. But it is more strictly used
to include those cases only in which the form of indirect Quotation
is given to some complete proposition or titatium which may be
extended to a narrative or address of any length-as found in the
Speeches os Caesar and Livy, -the form being dependent on some
word of soyinp, dre, with which it is introduced.

The term Drancr Drscouasa (oratio recta) includes all other
forms of expression, whether narration, question, exclamation, or

command.
