⁷2. 2, 3·] aaarrcrrnss. 203

a. Adiectlve rosel The present and perfect participles
are used sometimes as attributes, nearly like adjectivae: as,

cum antiquissimam sententiam tum comprobatam (Div. i. 5),
a view at once most ancient aad approved.

signa punquam sere ementientia (id. 9), arkas hardly ever

auisslllllurl'tuntur coactis (id. 15), they use forced auspices.

a. Thus they are used, like adjectives, as nouus: aa,

sibi indulgentes et corpori deservientes (Leg.i.13),therelf·
indulgent, and slaves to tle body.

recte sacta paria esse debent (Par. iii. 1), right deeds ought to
be like in valae.

male parta male dilabuntur (Phil. ii. 27), e'llgot‚ ill spent.

consuetudo valentis (De Or. ii. 44), tle dabit osa onan in heallb.

b. So, also, they are connected with nouus by esse and simi·
lar verbs: as,

videtis ut senectus sit operosa et semper agens aliquid et
moliens (Cat. M. 8), you see how busy old ogeis, always
ar‘mr'ng aad trying at something. .

Gallia est omnis divisa (B. G. i. 1), all Gaul is divided.

locuslquidnunc saeptus est (Liv. i. 8), tlte place which is now
eac ose .

c. From this adjective use arise the compound tenses of the
passive-the participle of eompleted action with the incompleta
tenses ofesce developing the idea of past time: as,

interfectus est, be was (or hasbeen) killed, lit, le is leothg-
been-killed [i.e., already alain}

d. In the best writers (as Cicero) this participle, when used
with the tenses of completed action, retains its prop'er iorce; but
iu later writers the two sats of tenses (as, amatus sum or fui)
are often used indiscriminately: as,

[leges] cum 'quae latae sunt tum vero quae promulgata fuerunt
(Sest 25), the lawr, both those which were proposed, aad
those whreh were publtsled. [The proposal os the laws was
a single act: hence lalce sunt is a pure perfect. The publish-
ing, or posting, was a continued state, which is indicated by
promulgatae, andfuerunt is the pure perfect]

arma quae fixa in parietibus fuerant, humi inventa sunt (Div.
titt §.titt 5553sstlstpdt‘t'tttt·‘stttt‘tlzzt
(off. i.17): the difference between this and the preceding
is, that occupatus can be used only as an adjective]

8. Poediculo sace. The Present and Perfect participles
are often used as a predicate, where in English a clause
