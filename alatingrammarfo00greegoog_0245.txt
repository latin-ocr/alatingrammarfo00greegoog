government of the verb, and moditiod by adverbs‚ buliu
grammatical construction following the same rules as nouus

tinnire-The use of the Gerund, in the obli ue cases, cor
responds to the use of the Infinitive as Subject (ξ 57, 8, α), its
nominative form being found only in the impersonal use of the
participle in dus: as, ·
ars bene disserendi et vera ac falsa dijudicandi (De Or. ii. 38),
tho ort o discourst'ng well, arrd dr'stingmlshing tte true and
salse. Here the verbal nouns drlscoursr'ng and distinguish-

infinitivo disserere and dtjudicore]

young teget, sor the old to enjoy (compare 5 51, 3, 4).

agreeing with the noun, and in the case which tho gerund

would have had: as,

paratiores ad omnia pericula subeunda (B. G. i. 5), readier to
undergo all dangers. [Here subeunda agrees with pericula,
which is itsels governed by od: the construction with the
gerund would be, ad subcrudum, ‘stu‘ ad governing the

mamad, and the gerund governing the accusative pereso]
