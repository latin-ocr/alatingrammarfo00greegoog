4. Structure· Latin expresses the relation of words ιο
each other by inflection, rather than by position, like modern
. languages. Hence its structure not only admits of great
variety in the arrangement of words, but is especially favor-

able to that form of sentence which is called a Periosl. Ina
Α period, the sense is expressed by the sentence as a whole, and
is held in suspense till the delivery of the last-word, which
usually expresses the main action or motive.

An English sentence does not often admit this form oi
structure. It was imitated, sometimes with great skill and
hsauty, by many of the early writers of English prose3 but
its effectis better seen in poetry, in such a passage as tho
following:-

“ High on a thmns of royal state, which far
Outshme tho wealth of Ormus and of -lnd,

Or where the gorgeous East with richest haul

Showers on her kings barbarie pearl and gold,

eatan exalted saw
Pocads'se bost, Book 11. 1-6.
