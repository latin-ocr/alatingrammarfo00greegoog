The prosody of the earlier Latin poeta differs in several
respecta from that of the later.

Nora. -Belore the language was used in literature, ia had &come
liii lllllllltllillellbliill titllfflbildtllitllsl‘
nee inyits position, but in Latin heom limited to the pennglt and
antepenult. This tendency was arrested hythe study os murmur
and by literature, but shows itseli again in the Romance langnages.
In many cases this change was still in progress in the time of tho

early poeta.

a· Aa the end of words a was only feebly scanderi, so that it
does not make position with a following consonant, and is some·
times cut off before a vowel. (This usage continues in all poeta
till Cicero's time: see §§1,2,6; 80, 2, note.)

b· The last syllable os any word os two syllables may be made
short if the first is short. (This effect remained in a few worda
like puta, cave, vale, vide.) Thus:-

ibest (Cist. ii. r, 12), epid test (Trin. 196); sorba dictast (Ena.
157); bonis (Stich. 99) ; domideaequeffseud. 37), domi (Mil. 194).

ὀ· The same effectis produced when a short monosyllable pre·
cedes along syllable: as,

ld est prolecto (Mera. 372), erit et tibi §xoptatum (Mil. 1011),
si quidem hercle (Asin 414), quid est si hoc (Andria, 237).

ab In a few isolated words position is often disregarded. Such
are, ssle,1ate,1nde,iinde,nempe, esse (2²). (Scholars are not
yet agreed upon the principle in this irregularity, or its extent.)

e· In some cases the aocent seems to shorten a syllable preced-
ing it in a word of more than three syllables: as in senectiub

Syracusae.

f· At the beginning oi averse, many syllables long by position
stand for short ones: as,
idne tu (Pseud. 442); estne consimilis (Epid. v. 1. 18).
