-a Final a ol the first declension is osten long: aa,

ne epistula quidem rilla sit in aedibus (Asin. 762).
Pol hodie altera jam bis detonsa certost.

2. Final a of the neuter plural is sometimes long (though thore
seems no etymological reason sor it): as,

(Ρ Νιῑηὲ e)t amico prosperabo et genio med multa bona faciam
ers. 2 3.

³. So also nouns in -or with long stem, either with original r
or original a: as,

modo quom dicta in me ingerebas odium non uxor eram
(Ag-133) pectore itque corde inicit amor incendium (Mero. 590).

atque quanto n6x luisti longior hoc proxuma (Amph 548).

4. So in nouns with vowel lengthened originally by loss of a
consonant: as, miles, superstites.

5. So all verb-endings in r and t, where the vowel is elsewhere
long in inflection: as,

regredior audisse me (Capt 1023); atque ut qui fueris et qui
nunc (Capt. 248); me nominat haec (Epid. iv. 1, 8); faciat ut sem·
per (Poen. ii. 42); infumabat, amabo (Cretics, Gist i. 1, 21); qul
amet (Marc. 1021); ut stt in bello capitur alter filius (Oapt 25);
tibi sit ad me revisas (Truc. ii. 4, 79).

h· The hiatus is allowed very freely‚ especially at apanse in the
sense, or when there is a change of the speaker. (The extent ol
this license is still a question among scholars, but in the present
state of texts it must sometimes be allowed.)

1. Date of Y ear. The year was dated, in earlier times,
by the names of the Consuls3 bnt was afterwards rechoned
from the building of the City (ab arbe conditd, or anno urbis
condite), the date of which ¹was assigned by Varro to a period
corresponding with no. 753. In order, therefore, to reduce
Roman dates to those of the Christian era, tle year os llas
’ city is to be subtracturi from 754: eg. mue. 691 (the year
of Cicero’s consulship) = no. 63.
