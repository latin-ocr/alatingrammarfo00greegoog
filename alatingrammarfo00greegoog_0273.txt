2. ww Roman Yeor. Before Caesar's reform of the
Calendar (ac. 46), the Roman year consisted of 355 days:
March, May, Quintilis (duly), and October having each 31
days, February having 28, and each of the remainder 293
withan Intercalary mouth, on alternate years, inserted after
February 23, at the discretion of the Pontifices. The “Ju-
lian year,” hythe reformed calendar, had 365 days, divided
as at present. Every fourth year the alth of February (vi.
kal. Mart) was counted twice, giving 29 days to that mouth:
hence the year was called Bissextilia The mouth Quintilis
received the name Julius (July), in honor of Julius Caesar3

and Sextilis of Augustus (August), in honor of his successor.

The Julian year (see below) remained unohanged till the adop·
tion of the Gregorian Calendar (sm. 1582), which omits leap-ycar
once iu every century.

8. The Monta. Debes, according to the Roman Calen-
dar, are rechoned as follows:-

a. 'l'heflrat day of the mouth was called Kalendae (dolenda),
from calare, to colb—that being the day ou which the poutiffs
publicly announced the New Moou in the Comitia Galata, which
they did, originally, from actual observation.

b. Sixteen days before the Calends,-that is, on the fiffccall
day of March, May, July, aud October, but the thimnata of the
other months—were the Idus (Ides), the day of Full Moon.

c. Eight days (the ninth by the Roman rechoning) before tho
Ides, - that is, ou the serentis day of March, May, J uly, and Octo-
ber, but the fiflh of the other months, -were the Nonae (Nona.
oraintfta).

d· From the three points thus determined the days of tha
mouth were rechoned bocluoorda (the point of departure being,
by Roman custom, couutcd iu the reckouing), giving the following
rule for determining the date ε -

If the given date be Calends, add two to the number of days
in the mouth preceding—if Nones or ides, add oue to that of
the day ou which they fall—and from the number thus ascer-
tained subtract the given datm-thus, viii. Kal. Feb. (33-8) =
Jau. 25;—iv. Non. Mar. (8-4)=Mar. 43-iv. Id. Sept.

ι (14-4)=sept.10.
