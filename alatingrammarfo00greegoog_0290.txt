APPENDIX. ·

..q-

Lerne was originally the language of the plain of Latium, iying
south oi the Tiber, the first territory occupied and governed by the
Romans. This language, together with the Greek, Sanskrit, Zend
(old Persian), the Sclavenic and Teutonic familiea, and the Celtic,
are shown by comparative philology to be offshoots of a common
atock, alanguage once spoken by a people aomewhere in the in·
terior of Asia, whence the different branches, by successive migra·
tione, peopled Europe and Southern Asia.

The name Indo-European (or Aryan) is given to the whole
group of languageS, aa well as to the original language from which
the branches aprang. By an extended comparison of the cor-
responding rocta, stema, and forms, as they appear in the different
branches, the original (“ Indo-European”) root, stem, or form ean
in very many cases be determined; and this is used as a model,
or type, to which the variatione may be referred. A few of these
forma are given in the grammar sor comparison (aee, especially,
p. 59). A sew are here added for further illustration:
