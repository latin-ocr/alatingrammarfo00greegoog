very considerably cheoked or suppressed. Oratione, rhetorical
works letters, and bistones-dealing with the practical affairs
ond passione of politice-seem to be nearly all that sprang direct
from the native soil 'l'he Latin poets os the Empiro were mostly
courtpoets, writing for a cultivated and luxurious class ; satires and
epistles alone keep the flavor ol Roman manners, and exhibit the
familiar features of Italian life.

In its use since the classic period, Latin is known chiefly as
the language of the civil Oode, which gave the law to alarge part
of Europe; as the lenguage of historiens, diplomatists, and philos·
ophers during the Middle Age, and in some countries to a much
later period; as the official language of the Ghurch and Court of
Rome, down to the present day; as, until recently, the common
language of scholare, so as still to be the ordinary channcl of com·
manication among many learned classes and societies; and as the Ι
universal language os Seianae, especially of the descriptive sciences,
so that many hundreda os Latin tenns, or derivative forms, must be
known familiarly to any one who would have a clear knowledge of
the facts of the natural world, or be able to recount them intelli-
gibly to men os science. In some of these uses it may still be
regarded as a living languagc; while, conventionally, it retains its
place as the foundation of a liberal education.

During the classical period of the language, Latin existed not
·0nly in its literary or urban form, but in several local dialects,
known by the collective name of linqua rustica, sar simpler in the
forms of inflection than the classic Latin. This, it is probable, was
the basis of modern Italian, which has preserved many of the
ancient words without aspirato or case-inflection, as orto (hortus),
pente (qens). In the colonies longest occupied by the Romans,
Latin-often in its ruder and more popular form— grew into the
language of the common people. Hence the modern languages
called “Romanae” or “Romania'’; viz, Italian, Spanish‚ Portu
guese, and Frenoh, together with the Catalan of Northeastern

zSpain, the Provenpal or Troubadour langnsge of the South of
France, the “ Rouman ” or Walachian of the lower Danube (Rou-
mania), and the “Roumansch” of some districts of Switzerland

A comparison of words in several of these tongues with Latin
will serve to illustrate that process of phonetic decay to which
reference has been made in the body of this Grammar, as well as
